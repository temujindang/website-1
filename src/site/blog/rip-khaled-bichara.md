description: RIP Khaled Bichara, 1971-2020
---

We were deeply saddened to learn that 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Bichara">Khaled Bichara</a>, 
one of Oxide's angel investors, 
<a href="https://www.menabytes.com/khaled-bichara-dies-car-accident/">died in a car accident in Cairo on Friday night</a>. 

Those of us who have known Khaled for years have known him to be a bold 
investor who appreciated hard technical problems -- and also a profoundly 
decent person, who cared deeply for his family, his companies, and his country.
Khaled's stories of kindling entrepreneurship in Egypt were inspiring to any 
who heard them -- and served as a reminder of the reponsibility that we all 
have to our broader communities.  Our most recent conversation with Khaled -- 
just a few short months ago -- remains vivid: he was excited by our technical 
vision and thrilled to be a part of Oxide. For our part, we were looking 
forward to a long journey together, and to making good on his belief in us; 
we are gutted to have lost him so abruptly. Our heart goes out to his family, 
and to all those who he touched over his career; Silicon Valley may be a long 
way from Cairo, but his impact and 
<a href="https://waya.media/the-legacy-of-khaled-bichara/">legacy</a> will 
be felt here for years to come.
